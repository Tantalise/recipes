    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1><em>In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, </em></p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 fresh eggs</li>
      <li>quarter teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>half teaspoon cold water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>pepper and other spices to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, salt, and water together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and before it starts to sizzle, pour in the whisked eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and "scrambling" eggs, shaking pan to keep leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.

        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface of the eggs to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness. As soon as surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Roll and serve the omlette as you please</li>
    </ol>
